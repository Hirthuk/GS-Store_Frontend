- **react-router-dom**: This is used for client-side routing in React applications.
 It helps in navigating between pages without a full reload and provides features like `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, 
 `Link`, and `useNavigate` for handling navigation.  

- **react-toastify**: This is used to show toast notifications (small pop-up messages) in a React app.
 It allows customizable success, error, and info messages with auto-dismiss and styling options.

Used in Main.js to route the pages inside the app.
 `<BrowserRouter>` in `main.js` is used to enable client-side routing in a React app. It wraps the entire application, allowing navigation between pages without a full page reload. 
 It replaces `<StrictMode>` when focusing on routing instead of React‚Äôs development warnings. üöÄ

group (Parent-Child Styling)
group is a Tailwind utility class that allows styling child elements based on the state of a parent element (like hover, focus, or active).

2Ô∏è‚É£ relative (Positioning)
relative is used to set an element‚Äôs position relative to its normal placement, allowing child elements to be positioned absolutely inside it.

We have implemented this using small screen navbar- We made the element absoulte of that it wil be relative to body(No other element has relative so no parent)
This make it sit on top of the elements
Use relative on the parent if you want absolute children to be positioned inside it.
